# == Define: stunnel::tun
#
# Creates a tunnel config to be started by the stunnel application on startup.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*namevar*]
#   The namevar in this type is the title you give it when you define a resource
#   instance.  It is used for a handful of purposes; defining the name of the
#   config file and the tunnel section in the config, as well as things like
#   the PID file.
#
# [*certificate*]
#   Signed SSL certificate to be used during authentication and encryption.
#   This module is meant to work in conjuction with an already established
#   Puppet infrastructure so we are defaulting to the default location of the
#   agent certificate on Puppet Enterprise.
#
# [*private_key*]
#   In order to encrypt and decrypt things there needs to be a private_key
#   someplace among the system.  Just like certificate we use data from Puppet
#   Enterprise.
#
# [*ca_file*]
#   The CA to use to validate client certificates.  We default to that
#   distributed by Puppet Enterprise.
#
# [*crl_file*]
#   Currently OCSP is not supported in this module so in order to know if a
#   certificate has not been revoked, you will need to load a revocation list.
#   We default to the one distributed by Puppet Enterprise.
#
# [*ssl_version*]
#   Which SSL version you plan to enforce for this tunnel.  The preferred and
#   default is TLSv1.
#
# [*chroot*]
#   To protect your host the stunnel application runs inside a chrooted
#   environment.  You must devine the location of the processes' root
#   directory.
#
# [*user*]
#   The stunnel application is capable of running each defined tunnel as a
#   different user.
#
# [*group*]
#   The stunnel application is capable of running each defined tunnel as a
#   different group.
#
# [*pid_file*]
#   Where the process ID of the running tunnel is saved.  This values needs to
#   be relative to your chroot directory.
#
# [*debug_level*]
#   The debug leve of your defined tunnels that is sent to the log.
#
# [*log_dest*]
#   The file that log messages are delivered to.
#
# [*client*]
#   If we running our tunnel in client mode.  There is a difference in stunnel
#   between initiating connections or listening for them.
#
# [*accept*]
#   For which host and on which port to accept connection from.
#
# [*connect*]
#  What port or host and port to connect to.
#
# [*conf_dir*]
#   The default base configuration directory for your version on stunnel.
#   By default we look this value up in a stunnel::data class, which has a
#   list of common answers.
#
# [*verify*]
# verify peer certificate, verify levels:
#   0 - Request and ignore peer certificate.
#   1 - Verify peer certificate if present.
#   2 - Verify peer certificate.
#   3 - Verify peer with locally installed certificate.
#   4 - Ignore CA chain and only verify peer certificate.
#   undef - no verify
#
# [*retry*]
#   reconnect a connect+exec section after it's disconnected
#
# [*foreground*]
#   Stay in foreground (don't fork) and log to stderr instead of via syslog (unless output is specified).
#
# [*ssl_options*]
#   OpenSSL library options
#
# [*socket_options*]
#   Set an option on accept/local/remote socket, can be an array of options
#
# === Examples
#
#   stunnel::tun { 'rsyncd':
#     certificate    => "/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/${::clientcert}.pem",
#     private_key    => "/etc/puppet/ssl/private_keys/${::clientcert}.pem",
#     ca_file        => '/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem',
#     crl_file       => '/etc/puppet/ssl/crl.pem',
#     chroot         => '/var/lib/stunnel4/rsyncd',
#     user           => 'pe-puppet',
#     group          => 'pe-puppet',
#     client         => false,
#     accept         => '1873',
#     connect        => '873',
#     verify         => '2',
#     retry          => false,
#     foreground     => false,
#     ssl_options    => 'DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS',
#     socket_options => ['l:TCP_NODELAY=1','r:TCP_NODELAY=1']
#   }
