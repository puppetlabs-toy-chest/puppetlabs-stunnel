## Summary
Provides a defined resource type for managing stunnel on Debian and Red Hat systems.

## Usage
```
   stunnel::tun { 'rsyncd':
     certificate => "/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/${::clientcert}.pem",
     private_key => "/etc/puppet/ssl/private_keys/${::clientcert}.pem",
     ca_file     => '/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem',
     crl_file    => '/etc/puppet/ssl/crl.pem',
    chroot      => '/var/lib/stunnel4/rsyncd',
     user        => 'pe-puppet',
     group       => 'pe-puppet',
     client      => false,
     accept      => '1873',
     connect     => '873',
   }
```

## Notes
* There is no sysvinit script installed as part of the `stunnel` package on Red Hat systems.
* Use of SSLv2 is highly discouraged because it's known to be vulnerable.
* The chroot defined in `stunnel::tun` needs to be manually created.
